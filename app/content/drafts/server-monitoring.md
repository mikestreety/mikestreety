title: Server tools - htop and apache server status

---

Wanting to debug what is going on with a server, this will kind of be like a live blog (at time of writing i've not actually solved the issue).

- Advanced server status (https://www.axel-hahn.de/docs/apachestatus/get_started.htm)
- Go access (live)
- Go access (scheduled)
