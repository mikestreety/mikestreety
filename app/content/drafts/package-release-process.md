title: changelog

At Liquid Light, we maintain several [public](https://github.com/orgs/liquidlight/repositories) and private packages for our TYPO3 installations. Over the last couple of years, we have honed the development and release process of the packages so that 6 developers independently work on our extensions.

## Workflow

I'll go into more detail below, but the workflow is:

- Make an issue
- Create a merge request
- Work on the code
- Update `UPCOMING.md`
- Push branch and request peer review
- Merge with merge commit
- Test
- (Optional) Release
