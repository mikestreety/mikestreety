On the face of it, when reflecting back on 2024, it seemed a bit of an uneventful year. No children were born, no major world events happened and I didn't even buy a new bike.

However when I looked back through my photos and had a _proper_ think about what happened, it turned out to be a pretty good year. Plenty of adventures with the family, I went on a plane for the first time and long time and I _did_ buy a bike related thing.

## Trips out & holidays

2024 saw a couple of holidays, plenty of days out to musicals and theme parks (it helps that we're Merlin annual pass holders) and I also rediscovered going to [gigs](/gigs-and-shows/) (and hope to go to a few more in 2025).

As a family we went to Peppa Pig World, Drusillas, Legoland (twice, once at Halloween and the other at Christmas), Chessington and the Sea Life Centre (Alfie got a bonus trip to Sea Life Centre twice and another to Chessington in the school holidays).

My wife and I went and saw Hamilton and Stranger Things - The First Shadow. We also took Alfie to his first show by taking him to see the Frozen musical in London.

There were only a couple of gigs I went to at the end of the year. Embrace were doing a 20th anniversary tour of their "Out of Nothing" at Chalk in Brighton. My obsession with Bastille this year was realised and I managed to get tickets to their "&" tour at the Shepherds Bush Empire, along with seeing Dan perform some songs at Resident, a small record shop in Brighton.
