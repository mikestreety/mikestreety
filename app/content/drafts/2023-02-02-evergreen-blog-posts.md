Evergreen topics are the golden egg of blog posting; posts which don't age and don't become irrelevant over time. I really wish I wrote more blog posts which weren't about a specific framework or version number. A lot of my posts are about the here and now "this is how you do this thing with this technology". They might still be right in 1, 2 or 3 years time, or they might not.

Even my most popular posts about [Migrating Gitlab to another server](/blog/migrating-gitlab-from-one-server-to-another/ "Gitlab") or [Creating a Docusaurus Docker container](/blog/creating-a-docusaurus-docker-image-for-consistent-rendering-of-your-documentation/) website can easily be rendered useless with the release of a new version or a change in the commands to be run.

It's not easy creating evergreen content - I envy those that can come up with philosophical or timeless talks, too. If you want to be seen as a "thought leader" (horrible phrase, but you get my drift) then you need to start creating blog posts and presentations that don't age and will always be relevant.

I have managed to write *some* evergreen blog posts - my [Git commit hash](/blog/the-git-commit-hash/) and "[Making sure you're not doing everything at work](/blog/making-sure-youre-not-doing-everything-at-work/)" posts don't have an expiry date (unless Git fundamentally change the way hashes are made) but the [majority of my posts](/diary/) are fixed to a specific time.

I see posts and opinions crop up and sometimes kick myself. Blogs which get the web development community rallying behind express views which I hold, and have done for a while, I just never considered it blog worthy enough (or a popular enough opinion). Perhaps I need to stop holding back with writing about my opinion on things. Perhaps I need to _just_ type whatever is on my mind or put down thoughts whenever I roll my eyes or tut at something in the industry. On the flip side, I should write more about the positive things I see on the web.

As an aside, I logged into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to see what it could suggest for "**Web development evergreen topic ideas**" and the list it has generated is something I might lean on in the future.

- Responsive design and mobile optimization
- Search engine optimization (SEO)
- Security and privacy considerations
- Web performance optimization
- The role of APIs in web development
- The future of web development technologies, such as WebAssembly or Web VR
- Web accessibility and inclusive design
- Progressive web apps (PWA)
- Design patterns and best practices for creating user-friendly websites
- The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in web development

If I wanted to stir things up, I could write about one of the following "**Argumentative web development topics to blog about**" (according to ChatGPT)

- The future of native apps vs. progressive web apps.
- The usefulness of web development certification programs.
- The necessity of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript before moving to frameworks.
- The role of web developers in cyber security and protecting user data.
- The importance of performance optimization in web development.
- The debate over static vs. dynamic websites.
- The impact of website monetization on user experience.
- The need for web developers to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.
- The pros and cons of using CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less.
- The debate over the use of proprietary software vs. open-source tools in web development.

Although in hindsight, I wouldn't say much of this is "argumentative" as you could answer every one of those statements with "it depends".
