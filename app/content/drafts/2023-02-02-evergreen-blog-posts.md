Evergreen topics are the golden egg of blog posting; posts which don't age and don't become irrelevant over time. I really wish I wrote more blog posts which weren't about a specific framework or version number. A lot of my posts are about the here and now "this is how you do this thing with this technology". They might still be right in 1, 2 or 3 years time, or they might not.

Even my most popular posts about [Migrating Gitlab to another server](https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/migrating-gitlab-from-one-server-to-another/ "Gitlab") or building a [Creating a Docusaurus Docker container](https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/creating-a-docusaurus-docker-image-for-consistent-rendering-of-your-documentation/) website can easily be rendered useless with the release of a new version or a change in the commands to be run.

It's not easy creating evergreen content - I envy those that can come up with philosophical or timeless talks, too. If you want to be seen as a "thought leader" (horrible phrase, but you get my drift) then you need to start creating blog posts and presentations that don't age and will always be relevant.

I have managed to write *some* evergreen blog posts.
