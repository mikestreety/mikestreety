I've been on my coffee "journey" for a while now and have finally taken the plunge to upgrade my coffee grinder to a Niche Zero. With that in mind, I thought I would post about where I've been so far with my coffees and a comparison in workflows between the two grinders.

It's worth noting that I am, by no means, a coffee aficionado. However, I am a coffee hipster and will forgo having one out unless I know it will be a good one because "I can make one better at home". I struggle to identify the nuances of a coffee, but do know if one is good or bad
