2023 was a year which seemed to fly by. It doesn't seem like 12 months have passed since I was last reflecting my annual achievements. There were some pretty big events this year, when I _actually_ think about it, but it all seems to be compressed into, what feels like, only a couple of months.

As with [previous years](/category/annual-review/), these posts are written mainly for me, to reflect on the year and think about the one coming.

## Life

There was a major milestone this year - Alfie starting school. We picked the school _last_ December and found out in April we'd got our first choice. My wife and I were quite apprehensive about how he would be, but he thoroughly enjoys it. He is absolutely smashing reading, writing and maths too. With Alfie starting school, all our home routines changed (again), but we've made it work.

Alfie (and my wife) also started at Squirrels - the pre-cursor to Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. He was wary to start with but is starting to join in with the activities, without being glued to my wife the whole evening.

2023 also saw plenty of trips out on Bob (the cargo bike), along with utilising it's carrying capacity - picking up bits on my lunch breaks for the house and garden. We also went to see the Flying Scotsman at our local steam railway and took the kids to their first wedding.

Holidays saw us go to Butlins, Alton Towers (staying in the hotel) and Center Parcs. The garden got another face-life (after letting it run wild) and it now in a more manageable state for taking care of - I actually use the opportunity when walking down to the garden office to do a spot of weeding or pruning.

### Bike

I can't seem to go through a year without buying a new bike. This time, it was a new commuter bike's turn to be replaced. I never got on with the [Genesis](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUf7u6pIatL/) really, I didn't enjoy the gear shifter location or the seating position and the the hub gear made me constantly worry about getting a puncture (as I didn't know how to take the back wheel off).

My new bike is a [Triban RC520](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/road-bike-rc-520-disc-brake-prowheel-blue/_/R-p-348230). I could find nothing but good reviews for Triban bikes and it had everything on my wish list. It reminds me of the old [Planet X London Road](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0dA_UTn4_Y/) I had. Trusty & nippy without being fragile.

While on the topic of bikes, we finally managed to convince Alfie to ride one with pedals. For ages he was riding a pedal bike as a balance bike, but he is now speeding off and getting more and more confident each time. He enjoys it too, which helps!

### Liquid Light

2023 saw a lot of new faces start working for Liquid Light which also means a few people left. With no-one handing in their notice since 2019, a lot of the staff had been with us for a fair amount of time so it was no surprise. This year we had 5 people hand in their notice and 6 people join. Fortunately, no two people left for the same reason - most going off to pursue different interests but, as with any staff churn, it is going to put pressure on the business.

We welcomed 3 developers (2 front-end, 1 backend) 2 new designers and 1 new account manager meaning every department had a new face. With new faces, though, come new processes, suggestions, ideas and energy. Most of this year was spent bedding the new staff in, so I'm looking forward to what we can do in 2024 with all this fresh blood.

On the tech side, the biggest accomplishment was setting up [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate). This is a bot/script that runs on a scheduled CI job and keeps dependencies up-to-date. This ensures bugs are auto-fixed, merged and deployed while minor updates to packages are raised in a merge request.

We've continued with the upgrades and updates while still pushing forward with new builds and developments. We opened up a couple of new roles for our senior account manager and backend developer to give them more responsibility and reduce the pressure and workload on the directors.
