2023 was a year which seemed to fly by. It doesn't seem like 12 months have passed since I was last reflecting my annual achievements. There were some pretty big events this year, when I _actually_ think about it, but it all seems to be compressed into, what feels like, only a couple of months.

As with [previous years](/category/annual-review/), these posts are written mainly for me, to reflect on the year and think about the one coming.

## Life

There was a major milestone this year - Alfie starting school. We picked the school _last_ December and found out in April we'd got our first choice. My wife and I were quite apprehensive about how he would be, but he thoroughly enjoys it. He is absolutely smashing reading, writing and maths too. With Alfie starting school, all our home routines changed (again), but we've made it work.

Alfie (and my wife) also started at Squirrels - the pre-cursor to Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. He was wary to start with but is starting to join in with the activities, without being glued to my wife the whole evening.

2023 also saw plenty of trips out on Bob (the cargo bike), along with utilising it's carrying capacity - picking up bits on my lunch breaks for the house and garden. We also went to see the Flying Scotsman at our local steam railway and took the kids to their first wedding.

Holidays saw us go to Butlins, Alton Towers (staying in the hotel) and Center Parcs. The garden got another face-life (after letting it run wild) and it now in a more manageable state for taking care of - I actually use the opportunity when walking down to the garden office to do a spot of weeding or pruning.

### Bike

I can't seem to go through a year without buying a new bike. This time, it was a new commuter bike's turn to be replaced. I never got on with the [Genesis](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUf7u6pIatL/) really, I didn't enjoy the gear shifter location or the seating position and the the hub gear made me constantly worry about getting a puncture (as I didn't know how to take the back wheel off).

My new bike is a [Triban RC520](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/road-bike-rc-520-disc-brake-prowheel-blue/_/R-p-348230). I could find nothing but good reviews for Triban bikes and it had everything on my wish list. It reminds me of the old [Planet X London Road](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0dA_UTn4_Y/) I had. Trusty & nippy without being fragile.

While on the topic of bikes, we finally managed to convince Alfie to ride one with pedals. For ages he was riding a pedal bike as a balance bike, but he is now speeding off and getting more and more confident each time. He enjoys it too, which helps!

### Liquid Light

2023 saw a lot of new faces start working for Liquid Light which also means a few people left. With no-one handing in their notice since 2019, a lot of the staff had been with us for a fair amount of time so it was no surprise. This year we had 5 people hand in their notice and 6 people join. Fortunately, no two people left for the same reason - most going off to pursue different interests but, as with any staff churn, it is going to put pressure on the business.

We welcomed 3 developers (2 front-end, 1 backend) 2 new designers and 1 new account manager meaning every department had a new face. With new faces, though, come new processes, suggestions, ideas and energy. Most of this year was spent bedding the new staff in, so I'm looking forward to what we can do in 2024 with all this fresh blood.

On the tech side, the biggest accomplishment was setting up [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate). This is a bot/script that runs on a scheduled CI job and keeps dependencies up-to-date. This ensures bugs are auto-fixed, merged and deployed while minor updates to packages are raised in a merge request.

We are also starting to look into testing (yes, I know) and I've done some research into a few popular frameworks - settling on Backstop for lighter regression testing and Playwright for more in-depth end-to-end testing. I wrote a blog post [summarising the meta-frameworks i've created around them](/blog/frameworks-tools-and-utility-meta-packages-for-quicker-configuration/).

We've continued with the upgrades and updates while still pushing forward with new builds and developments. We opened up a couple of new roles for our senior account manager and backend developer to give them more responsibility and reduce the pressure and workload on the directors. I'm looking forward to see how these two progress over time.

### Side Projects

Side projects took a bit of a hit this year as I delved into work-related evening activities. The work on Renovate, beginning of testing and optimising processes occupied my mind, along with the ongoing upgrades.

[Ale House Rock](https://alehouse.rocks/) had a couple of small improvements - brewery pages are now richer (with content pulled from Untappd) and more of the information is unified. I've also reduced the reliance on the numbers in the code for identifying the beers as it became muddle when I posted a duplicate.

This year I've managed to adopt a new physical side-project - puzzles. Kick-started when building Lego with my son, My wife and I have an ongoing puzzle that sits under the sofa and comes out on occasion. It's nice to have a no-screens hobby to turn to in the evening. I've also re-joined a gym, trying my best to go twice a week. I'm not following any routine, but I've been joining classes and  just to have a room to get a bit sweaty in helps clear my mind.

Talking of evenings, we got "the kids" a fish tank with fish for Christmas, however my wife and I are far more interested in it then the kids are. I'm fascinated with the snails that have snuck in there and I'm enjoying tending to the plants and tank in the evenings.

Since October, I've been chipping away at an API-based side-project. The yet-to-be-named SaaS, is a central aggregation of your data allowing you to view everything you've been up to along with having an API itself. The end-game is power my [stats page](/stats/) and more as it is currently manually entered by me. I've so far got it connecting to Strava, Garmin, Goodreads, Last.fm, Spotify, Letterboxd, Untappd and processing a Geocaching export. I've got my sights set on more services too - it starts to become addictive adding more services.

## Stats

Talking of stats, the data [on my stats page](/stats/) has been updated. Side note, I uninstalled the Instagram app at the beginning of the year, so only uploaded 1 photo the whole year.

### Blog

After a shift in marketing & positioning at work, I've stopped writing for Liquid Light (which often bolstered my blog count). I don't know how, but 2023 was just 1 post off my biggest year (2021). It's great to see plenty of new posts becoming more popular but it still surprises me that a post from 2017 is in the top 2 (and has been since it was written).

I hope I can continue this cadence of post writing - it felt like a nice spread over the year and I'm hoping the testing we're introducing will help feed that. I also feel like I could write more posts about TYPO3 (the CMS we use at work) as I don't tend to blog about that at all.

### Geocaching

Despite [last year](/blog/2022-in-review/#geocaching) saying getting my 1000th find would be "easily doable", I had to make changes to head out a couple of times before the end of the year to do it. I did it, but only just. My rind rate dropped to just **0.263** per day (45% decrease) but I still got out, saw the countryside and got some fresh air.

### Activities

All my cycling stats increased, which was great to see. More regularly cycling to Brighton twice a week helped, along with cycling to and from the gym in the second half of the year. It's no surprise that my step count increased with the gym being added to my routine, but it is a surprise to see I burnt _less_ calories last year - I guess walking (Geocaching) counts more than a few "Bootcamp" classes at the Gym.
