I have recently been writing some small code snippets and examples for [alligator.io](https://alligator.io/). It's a great little website which takes front-end code and breaks them down into bitesize chunks.

Below is a list of the snippets i've written:

- [SCSS Maps](https://alligator.io/sass/sass-maps/)
- [SCSS Lists](https://alligator.io/sass/sass-lists/)
- [SCSS @each loops](https://alligator.io/sass/each-loops/)
- [SCSS If/Else statements](https://alligator.io/sass/if-else-statements/)
