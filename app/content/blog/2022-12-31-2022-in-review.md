2022 brought in some pretty wild events in the world. UK politics went a bit haywire - seeing 3 Prime Ministers and plenty of other job swaps, resignations and votes of no confident (including four chancellors of the exchequer).

We also saw the death of the Queen - something I was sure I would see in my lifetime when I _thought_ about it, but it was still unexpected none-the-less. King Charles now sites on the throne and, being brutally honest, I wonder if I'll see another monarch be crowned before my passing. My feelings towards the monarchy are conflicting and not helped with the perusal of Twitter during the funeral - plenty of arguments for both side were vocal (however, I did think it was an extortionate amount of money spent on it).

Talking of Twitter, 2022 saw the takeover by Elon Musk. I'm not sure of the whys and hows, but within days (and even hours) of completion of the sale, the workforce and morals of the birdsite significantly declined. At time of writing, it is a mere shell of itself. Most tech people have migrated over to Mastodon (pick your server of choice), while others have disappeared into the wind.

This year in review post is mainly for my self reflection and record. All the statistics have been updated [on the stats page](/stats/)

## The Side Projects

The side projects action was a bit sporadic over the year - I seemed to have moments of inspiration & motivation which would then falter. This blog was one of them as after a bumper blog-writing 2021 (32 posts), 2022 only saw 19 posts arrive (and just 1 for Liquid Light).

### Ale House Rock

However, Ale House Rock got a huge overhaul. It is now fully 11ty powered; which includes having the reviews & breweries as markdown files [in the repository](https://gitlab.com/mikestreety-sites/ale-house-rock). It's allowed me to come away from Instagram and move to the more appropriate [Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/mikestreety), however the code and content is now designed to be more agnostic to the service providing the content. The idea being that it is now easier to switch services/methods of posting.

### Behind the Source

2022 saw the revival of the "Behind the Source" moniker, but this time in the form [of a podcast](https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/podcasts/). In each episode I interviewed people who were experts in a topic to try and get out of them exactly what _something_ was. For example, I spoke to web-folk about [Svelte](https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/podcasts/s02e05-svelte-with-brittney-and-willow/), [Gitpod](https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/podcasts/s02e02-gitpod-with-pauline-narvas/) and even [jQuery](https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/podcasts/s02e03-jquery-with-tomasz-lakomy/).

It was a great process to go through and I learnt a lot from it. I'm undecided if I will continue in the new year but I'm certainly not discounting it.

## The Bikes

It seems not a "year in review" post goes by without some sort of bike related updates. After the devastation of having to return my cargo bike last year, 2022 saw the arrival of "Bob" ([token Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZFyzq7o6nv/)). We've had this bike for coming up for a year (having got it in January) and it's great. Both the kids love it and it serves as a second car - allowing me to take things places ([including Christmas trees](https://hachyderm.io/@mikestreety/109449791109715324)) and shuttle kids about. I've done over 1,500 miles on it this year and it handles everything I throw at it. Trying to get it in the bike shed at work is a bit of a battle, but I have a technique now.

I also got a bike for my wife for Christmas. It's an electric one so she can keep up with me and the kids when in Bob. We've already been on a trip to the library and I'm hoping 2023 is the year we start doing more trips by bike and leaving the car at home.


## Work Life

2023 saw us hire our first Junior Backend Developer. The Backend development team is now bigger than it ever has been and that is much needed as the projects we're undertaking are more and more complex. Despite being junior, Ankita is already picking up plenty of TYPO3 and other backend skills to take pressure of the other backend developers.

On the tech side, our [Gitlab CI](/category/gitlab-ci/) processes have stepped up and we are now deploying non-docker sits using it. Our linting game is improving too which is ensuring everyone is coding to the same standards. Despite the big challenges in debugging, I find the CI stuff really rewarding to work in - maybe it's the restrictions that add to the rush of adrenaline when something works.

We've also, for once, got some "values" the dev team are going to follow for 2023. The idea is that our internal development time & resources should be working towards them and they can help guide any decisions we need to make this year. The two values are **Unity** and **Efficiency**. We look after over 60 sites and the last couple of years have been spent optimising and innovating - we now need to take stock and ensure all our processes are unified and everything is up-to-date.

## Personal

At home, my wife left her job in teaching to pursue a career which gave her evenings and weekends back. The kids are forever growing up, Alfie is a big fan of Lego now (along with Uno and Snakes & Ladders). Ruby is walking and talking and her personality (of being an absolute joker) is starting to shine through.

As for [stats](/stats)...

### Activities

Cycling mileage increased, but _most_ of that was on Bob - I think I only managed one or two rides on the Sunday bike this year, along with a similar amount of non-cargo bike commutes to work.

Steps decreased, but calories burned increased (probably because of the cycling mileage increase). All in all, it was a more active year, but still not as active as I would like.

### Blog posts

The blog post popularity is a bit skewed as I changed analytics provider and lost a load of data (which was the cause of me switching). For example, I know the post about [improving Gitlab CI build speed](/blog/how-i-improved-the-speed-of-docker-builds-in-gitlab-ci/) gained a lot of traction when I posted it, but that isn't reflected in the table.
