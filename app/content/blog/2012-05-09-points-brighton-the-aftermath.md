Last night was the second of my mini-conferences, Points Brighton. It featured speakers and keynotes of all different varieties, and the infamous Points Bazaar (the raffle) was, once more, a hit. If you want to see how good it looked, the photos can be [found on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/78206174@N02/sets/72157629656132734/).

As it was my event, I'm not really in a position to give an impartial view about it (despite it being a huge success and amazingly brilliant). So instead, i'll leave it to others to review:

- [Good Developer Conferences by Amber Weinberg](http://www.amberweinberg.com/good-developer-conferences/)
- [Points Mean Pixels by Adam Onishi](http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/)
- [Points Brighton - Points mean Pixels by Anthony Killeen](http://mrqwest.co.uk/209)

If you have a blog post of your own - let me know!

All that is left is the thanks yous and the credits - so bear with me.

## Speakers

Firstly, the reason everyone was there. The speakers. The presentations were fantastic, diverse and informative. Perfect really!

- [Amber Weinberg](http://www.amberweinberg.com/) [![](https://luckysoap.com/images/twittericon.gif "Twitter")](http://www.twitter.com/amberweinberg) stepped up first talking about '**Mobile Development**' (she kindly stepped in for the afflicted [Paul Mist](http://www.aislezero.co.uk/) [![](https://luckysoap.com/images/twittericon.gif "Twitter")](http://www.twitter.com/paulmist))
- Next was [James Seymour-Lock](http://simpleasmilk.co.uk) [![](https://luckysoap.com/images/twittericon.gif "Twitter")](http://www.twitter.com/jamesslock) discussing '**How To Achieve Your Clients Goals Through Effective Design**' ([Slides](http://speakerdeck.com/u/jamessl/p/how-to-achieve-your-clients-goals-through-effective-design))
- After, [Krystian Szastok](http://www.bozboz.co.uk), stepped up to the plate to show off his knowledge on '**The Principle Of Factor Sparsity And Seo**' ([Slides](http://prezi.com/doxamiiug8vk/the-principle-of-factor-sparsity-and-seo/))
- and finally finishing off the evening was [David Pomfret](http://simpleasmilk.co.uk) [![](https://luckysoap.com/images/twittericon.gif "Twitter")](http://www.twitter.com/pomennedy) who told us all about '**Making Type Right'** ([Slides](http://speakerdeck.com/u/pomennedy/p/typography-basics-points-brighton))

They all did brilliantly and based on the tweets, were all well recieved.

## Sponsors

The amount of generous people out there is phenomenal and there was no exception when it came to Points. We had books and t-shirts from [No Starch Press](http://nostarch.com/), books from [A Book Apart](http://www.abookapart.com/), t-shirts from [Belong](http://wearyoubelong.com/), several copies of Introducing HTML5 by Remy Sharp and Bruce Lawson, a book on mobile development from [Tipsy & Tumbler](http://www.tipsyandtumbler.co.uk/) and books and t-shirts from [5 Simple Steps](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/).

We also had some beautiful postcards designed and printed by [Hatched](http://www.hatchedlondon.com/) and [T/OD](http://www.toduk.com/). The alcohol and drinks were provided by [Bozboz](http://www.bozboz.co.uk) and the venue kindly donated by [The Skiff](http://www.theskiff.org/).

Massive thanks to anyone who sponsored the event.

## People Who Made It Happen

As with any event, there are always the unsung heroes. The people who really make the event happen and help ease the pressure.

- [Toby Howarth](http://tobyhowarth.co.uk/) - who designed the beautiful site.
- [Adam Onishi](http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/) - who made Toby's dreams a reality
- [Clive Walker](http://www.cvwdesign.com/) - who helped set up and lock up
- The clickers - who clicked for our wonderful presenters
- The attendees. Without whom, I could not have raised over £300 for [Tia's Trees](http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserProfilePage.action?userUrl=tiastrees). Thank you.

Keep an eye out for the next one!
