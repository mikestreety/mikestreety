At Liquid Light we have a staging server where work gets pushed to be previewed by the client. Over the last few months the server has had a couple of intermittent performance issues.

The server is currently running Debian 10 (Buster) with Apache, PHP-FPM and MySQL. The sites are typically running the TYPO3 CMS.

I thought I would create a "mini-series" of posts of what I am doing to investigate a slow server. Each post will be published over the next few days.
