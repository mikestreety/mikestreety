## Quiz Information

This quiz is 5 rounds with 7 questions in most rounds (except the picture round, which has 11).

Most answers are 2 points per correct answer (allowing single points to be rewarded where deserved).

When running the quiz I ask that phones are put away - more for politeness than fear of cheating. I also make it clear that the answers in the quiz are always right - even if they are not. This way it is fair and should hopefully avoid arguments.

### Round explanations

#### 1.Battlenips (and other parts)

Identify the grid reference where the specified body part of object is.

#### 2. Music

Fill in the missing lines of the song. Single points can be awarded if the teams are _nearly_ right.

#### 3. Film

Identify the films featuring my face

#### 4. Picture

I got my 7 & 4 year-olds to draw things from the garden and park. What are they?

#### 5. 2025

7 questions about what happened in 2025.

## The end

Let me know if you use this quiz and how you get on - was it to easy? to hard? to complicated?
