The idea of shower thoughts are things for you to ponder or wonder, these are ones that I have read on the internet (I take no credit) and often think about for no reason at all.

> Sleep is one of the few things we pretend to do to actually do it

Close your eyes, lie down and pretend until you actually drift off

> Cleaning your teeth is the only time we clean our skeleton

You don't see a skull with a beard, do you?

> Why do we have round lenses on cameras, but rectangle sensors and photos?

Surely the lens is capturing more of the photo then we ever see?

> Have you ever walked in a "space" of the earth that no human has before?

Doesn't matter what is actually under your feet, but has a human ever been to that lat/long before?
