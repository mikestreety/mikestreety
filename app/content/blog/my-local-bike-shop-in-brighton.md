<p>Living in Brighton, there is a huge array of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9PGYL">bike shops</a> to choose from. Ask any local cyclist and the phrase <em>"Support your local bike shop"</em> is often muttered - with people suggesting local independent small bike shops. However, if you ask me what my favourite bike shop was my reply would be, controversially, <strong>Evans</strong>.</p>

<p>With Evans being a chain, there are people who don't trust them. You don't have to look very hard to find a bad review about one of their stores online, but for me, they are all I could ask for.</p>



<p>I've had a couple of bad experiences with small bike shops; not being open when they are supposed to, or getting bad customer service because i'm not a regular or a full-on cyclist geek (well, I wasn't at the time!).</p>



<p>With Evans, you walk in and you don't feel intimidated. You can ask any question you want and no-one turns their nose up at you, but if you want to geek out the staff definitely know their stuff. </p>



<p>Anyone in an Evans shirt will bend over backwards for you. I've previously popped in with a gear issue and they were more than happy to take it out for a spin and tweak it and just today they were happy to look at a dodgy tyre. They have no problems with spending time explaining or helping you with queries.</p>



<p>Lastly, Evans Bike shop in Brighton are a shop I can <strong>trust</strong>. </p>



<p>So next time you need something doing on our bike, need a new inner tube or simply some advice on bikes, gears or pedals, don't be so quick to snuff Evans.</p>
