<p>Recently a friend, Chris, and I have embarked on the journey of building our own 3D printer. This is something I hugely recommend if you are into that kind of thing. It's taught me many things already and is amazing to see something moving that you've built. I'm in no way a mechanic, so this the kit car equivalent in my world.</p>

<p>This post isn't going to walk you though how to build a 3D printer, but is rather a collection of some tips and tricks we've learnt during the process, along with some links which have helped us understand. Think of it as your friend who has build a printer already, and is just sharing some knowledge to help you out.</p>



<p>The printer we have built/are building is the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)">RepRap Prusa Mendal - (Iteration 2)</a>.</p>



<h3>Hints</h3>



<p>Just some things to note if you are embarking on this journey. If you have something to add, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mikestreety">tweet me</a>!</p>



<ul>
<li>It takes longer than you think (<em>a lot</em> longer)</li>
<li>A 3D printer is never finished, it just gets to a state of "being"</li>
<li>You'll always find something to upgrade - so save your pennies</li>
<li>Don't be too precious - you'll rebuild every bit of it at some point</li>
<li>If you have a local hackspace/makerspace (like <a href="http://www.buildbrighton.com/">Build Brighonton</a>) become a member and go - there will be people to help and tools to use - there is a handy <a href="http://www.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page">list of makerspaces</a></li>
<li>No two printers are the same - yours will <em>look</em> like another, but work differently (or you might pick up slightly different parts)</li>
</ul>



<h3>Links</h3>



<p>Many hours of research have led me to this point, you will probably want to do your own research, but these links have helped immensely.</p>



<h4>Building</h4>



<p>For building the printer, these two guides were hugely helpful:</p>



<p><strong><a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_Assembly_(iteration_2)">The official RepRap guide</a></strong> - Big thanks to Neil Underwood for the videos!</p>
