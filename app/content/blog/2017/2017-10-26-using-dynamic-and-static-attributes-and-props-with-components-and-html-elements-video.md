This Vue.js tutorial explains the difference between dynamic and static attributes and props. It shows how you can pass variables to components or other HTML elements to display dynamic contents.

Using a colon, or v-bind, you tell Vue that the contents of the attribute, or prop, is dynamic. This means it can be a variable, a javascript expression or function. If you wish to pass in a simple string, you don't need to bind or use the colon.
