Long time no notes ðŸ™„

- IÂ have pushed a beta to my [Socket RSS](/blog/socket-rss-making-rss-your-mindless-scrolling-app)Â reader out to the public. I've already had a bit of feedback which is a great little incentive to keep working on it
- Over the last few weeks, me and a couple of friends have been [recording a podcast](https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/). It's an [OnTheSide](http://ontheside.network)Â takeover, so the conversation circles around side projects (IÂ talk a lot about RSS...)
- Turns out using a [controversial podcast title](https://twitter.com/MakeLifeWorkPod/status/1363780845581070336) gets a lot of attention. Who knew click baiting worked?!
- [Ale House Rock](https://www.instagram.com/ale_house_rock/) has been filling up nicely since Lockdown 3.0 started
- I've been really enjoying theÂ [Working Code](https://workingcode.dev/) podcast. Lack of commuting has not left much space for podcasts, but this one has shot to the top of the "must listen" list (along with [No Such Thing as a Fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/))
