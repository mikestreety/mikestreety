<div class="content"> <span class="photos"><span class="photo"><figure><img src="/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_youtube_47400db081.png" width="450" height="388" data-image="b8e5ph3v3u2z"></figure></span></span> <p class="featured">We are often asked whether videos for your website should be uploaded and hosted on your own website and server or if they should be uploaded to a social website such as YouTube, Vimeo or Facebook and then embedded. As with anything on the web, there isn’t a straightforward answer - however we’ve tried to help by outlining the the advantages of each below. </p> <h2 dir="ltr">Self-hosted</h2><ul><li><strong>You own the data</strong> - The video is hosted on your site, therefore the video data is 100% yours. No one can get your video banned or reported. It’s also harder for the average user to download your video.</li><li><strong>More direct traffic</strong> - If someone wants to share the video, the only place it exists is on your site - this means all the traffic to watch the video will be directed to your site</li><li><strong>Control over the design</strong> - If your video is self-hosted, it means you get 100% control over how the player looks. This means no third-party watermarks.</li><li><strong>No distractions</strong> - It’s all too easy to click through to a video on Youtube and, once that has finished, end up watching videos about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w2UxDdhZPk" target="_blank">a dog that can’t catch food</a>. If the video is on your own site, the user can’t get distracted and can continue to consume your content.</li><li><strong>No adverts</strong> - Video hosting websites are renowned for making the user wait for the content, but having it hosted yourself means people can dive straight in.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Third Party Hosting</h2><ul><li><strong>No worrying about bandwidth usage</strong> - Every time someone watches a video, it uses up bandwidth which could be a problem if yours is limited.</li><li><strong>Small file size</strong> - Video uploading and hosting tends to be all these services do so they are excellent at compressing the file to a much smaller size, making the page load lighter and quicker.</li><li><strong>Device optimisation</strong> - Different devices and browsers require different file formats. Third party services are capable of converting and serving the file required.</li><li><strong>Easy to use</strong> - Third party websites make uploading and embedding a video very easy, whereas self hosting requires some coding skills, or your CMS to allow you to upload your video directly.</li><li><strong>Social traffic</strong> - As easy as it is for your user to get distracted after watching your video, the same can happen for others stumbling upon yours while searching for a competitor.</li><li><strong>Simple player</strong> - Most third party vendors allow some customisation over their embedded players. This includes removing most branding and altering colours to match your website theme.</li><li><strong>Annotations</strong> - It’s quicker and easier to add annotations and comments to your videos on a dedicated platform, especially if it’s an afterthought. </li></ul><p>As you can see, there are many benefits to either solution and there isn’t a magical answer as to where you host your video. Ultimately, it entirely depends on your situation and requirements. I hope this post has helped clarify which option is best for you.</p>      </div>
