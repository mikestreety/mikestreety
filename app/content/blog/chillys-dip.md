<p><em>I found this in an old&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;book I found in a charity shop. Not quite sure what happened to it, but I've tweaked the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;and named it after my wife!</em><br></p>

<p>Great dip to go with anything including crisps, burgers or anything else you can dip!</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Ingredients:</strong></p>







<ul><li>6 tomatoes - peeled and finely chopped</li><li>1 small onion - finely chopped</li><li>1 sweet red pepper - finely chopped</li><li>100ml wine vinegar</li><li>100g caster sugar</li><li>1 tsp salt</li></ul>







<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>







<p>Chuck everything in a saucepan until it’s reduced - normally for about half an hour. Does about a jars worth which keeps in the fridge. Best when the tomatoes aren’t too juicy or if they are, tip the juice away before putting in the saucepan.</p>







<p>Chillis can be added for a bit of heat if desired.</p>
