<p>Twitter, Twitter Twitter.</p>

<p>How you have taken over the world? (And my life?)</p>







<p>I have recently properly got into Twitter. Before it was just a laborious update to show I was socially aware. I got lazy and integrated it with Facebook and Linked In. Meaning one update did them all. But now? Oh now I love the joys of Twitter and I cannot get enough.</p>







<p>My Twitter gets updated by numerous things, but more on that later. I love the fact you can integrate Twitter with EVERYTHING. As I said, my Twitter was hooked up with Facebook and Linked In. But recently I've been using Twitter a lot more and I didn't want to bombard, my Facebook friends (all 6 of them) and Linked In connections (2 of these!) with mindless bore of me talking to someone on Twitter.</p>







<p>I used to use the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/apps/application.php?id=2231777543&ref=ts">Twitter Application for Facebook</a> for the integration that way, and LinkedIn has its own integration option but this published everything I put on Twitter -&nbsp;including Retweets and Replies, which with the more I used Twitter, came more and more frequent. So it took it off.</p>







<p>I still <em>have </em>Facebook integration for my Twitter, in case I want to update them both, but i now use an Application called '<a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/selectivetwitter">Selective Tweets</a>'. This is a fantastic bit of code that looks at my tweets and only publishes the ones with <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">#fb</strong> at the end, which means My Facebook buddies only get a few updates a week. Rather than 3 an hour.</p>







<p>The same goes for my LinkedIn. Only tweets with an <strong>#in</strong> somewhere in the tweet makes its way OVER.</p>







<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Twintergration</strong>.</p>







<p>Its amazing.</p>







<p>I have plenty of things hooked up to my Twitter Account to update things and notify me and others of my happenings.</p>







<ul><li><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/">LoveFilm</a>: I am subscribed to Love Film and whenever they send me a new film, 'I' tweet it. Whenever they get a film Back that i watched, 'I' tweet it. Its amazing and has sparked conversations.</li><li><a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a>: This little legend is hooked up, watching this very blog via RSS feeds and will tweet whenever I post a new blog post!</li><li><a href="http://www.snaptu.com/">Snaptu</a>: Not so much automated, but this is what I use on my LG Renoir to Tweet. Nifty little app.</li><li><a href="http://twitpic.com/">TwitPic</a>: Just a simple little place to upload photos and Tweet them</li><li><a href="http://www.twaitter.com/">Twaitter</a>: Know you're going to be somewhere, doing something but unable to tweet? Just Twait it!</li></ul>







<p>Various websites allow you to now sign in with your Twitter account instead of having to create a new one which saves the laborious chore of entering your email.&nbsp;</p>







<p>You can turn your computer off remotely by tweeting to its own account. The things you can do with Twitter these days is endless!</p>







<p>I just love the fact that that there are so many features and functions available to do anything you want.</p>







<p>You can also put it everywhere. For example, I have my latest Tweet appearing at the top of my website, See? Shows that I'm on Twitter...</p>
