<p>So this isn't really "#7", it's more <a href="/blog/notes-7/">#6</a> part 2 as I am writing them both at the same time. However, this note tries to fill the July - Mid-September void.</p>
<h3>No Coding</h3>
<p>July and August kind of saw me down-tools on my side projects while I focused on the house. The garage (inside and out) needed painting, a long with the back of the house - so that occupied my mind which was a nice change. Half the inside of the garage is done (waiting for it to fully dry & for me to go to the tip before I do the other half) but the exterior walls are all finished.</p>
<p>The next project is building a garden office. It looks like we're going to be working from home for a while now, so to give more space indoors, my wife and I decided on getting a garden room built for me to work from. I'm not doing the building, but there is plenty of prep work needed to do beforehand.</p>
<p>Over the summer, "The Lockdown" eased slightly too. The UK government introduced a scheme which gave restaurants the ability to offer half-price food (although behind-the-scenes the restaurants are struggling to claim the money back). My wife and I took advantage though, and went out a couple of times. It was interesting to see how different places handled the situation - plenty did it very well while a couple left a lot to be desired.</p>
<h3>11ty</h3><p>I've been thinking about documentation and work and how best to store & maintain it. Our current system uses a slow CMS which is great, but puts you  off writing and updating. As a side-project, I started looking into <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and I liked what I saw. There were a few in-built conventions I had to fight against, but the <a href="https://gitlab.com/mikestreety/typo3-tips">starter I've got myself</a> is something I'm proud of.</p><p>Once i've fleshed out the styles & and used it a bit more to work out bugs, I might submit it as an 11ty Starter site.</p><h3>TYPO3 Upgrades</h3><p>Something that has been taking up a lot of my mental energy at the moment is TYPO3 - the CMS we use at Liquid Light. There is a major upgrade currently underway and it has fallen onto my shoulders to carry out. It's a "chuck in at the deep end" situation, but I'm learning a lot and it's good to see upgraded sites up and running - even if there isn't anything to "see"</p><h3>New Developer</h3><p>We're also <a href="https://liquidlight.peoplehr.net/Pages/JobBoard/Opening.aspx?v=9fa2168f-9d9a-4842-9a19-f5f907207f8a">hiring for a new backend developer</a>, which is going to be an interesting process interviewing remotely as, one day, we would like to go back to the office.  We'll see how that pans out!</p>
