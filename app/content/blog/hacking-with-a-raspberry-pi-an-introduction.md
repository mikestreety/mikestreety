<p>I've recently been playing around with Raspberry Pi and some hardware - seeing what else can be done with the tiny computer.</p>
<p>I previously wrote about using the pi as a <a href="http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/my-media-centre-solution">media centre</a>, but I wanted to try something else (after seeing a friend using his for house temperature readings).</p>
<p>I've always wanted a basic weather station, one that just told me the temperature outside so that I knew what to wear for cycling, and this is what I set out to create.</p>
<p>This will be the first in a series of blogs posts detailing the steps i've been through. I've made a prototype, but I'm about to embark on making something proper and so I will be making a note of what I'm doing (for my sake as well as yours!)</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>I already had my raspberry pi, but if you don't have one I would recommend getting (at time of writing) the B+ or (if you can spare the extra cash) a Raspberry Pi B 2 (the 2 being the important bit!)</p>
<p>I also picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sintron-T-Cobbler-Extension-Starter-Raspberry/dp/B00KKW6NEA/">starter kit</a> - although the documentation you get with it is appalling, it's good to have some starting hardware to use and call upon - then pick up the extra bits as when you need them.</p>
