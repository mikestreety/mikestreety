<div class="info">Since writing this post, I have since create a <a href="https://email.subscribeto.at/">email newsletter directory</a>.<br><br> I have created a <strong><a href="https://email.subscribeto.at/front-end-development">front-end developer specific page</a></strong> for recommended newsletters :raised_hands:</div>

Back in 2016 I wrote a blog post listing the [newsletters front-end developers should subscribe too](https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/newsletters-for-front-end-developers). A few years have passed and my interests have changed, so here is an updated list of email newsletters that I think front-end developers would benefit from:

I have recently found a service which gives you an email address to subscribe with along with an RSS feed for that email, so you can signup to newsletters and get them as RSS feeds! Wonderful!
