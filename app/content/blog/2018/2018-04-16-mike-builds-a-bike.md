	<strong>A note from 2024:</strong> with the questionable demise of Twitter/X incoming, I have copied some tweets & images as-they-were from the birdsite for preservation

## 16 February

A couple of weeks ago my Cannondale bike was involved in an altercation with a car park barrier while on top of the car.

Carbon bike frame, metal barrier and solid roof rack, unfortunately the bike lost and got written off.

So after much deliberation and research, Iâ€™ve decided to take on the challenge of building a bike myself. Hunting round Iâ€™ve found equal spec kit or better, coming in at Â£10 under the cost of what I got for the old bike.

---

Iâ€™ll tweet about the process purely so I can make a blog post about it at the end (also so I can ask for help ðŸ˜‰)

There will be tears, there will be blood. But my god Iâ€™m going to try and get a bike out of it at the end.

**Delivery 1:**

Full 105 groupset with hydraulic disc brakes.

**Delivery 4**

One disc rotor and a clamp to convert a braze on front derailleur to a clamp.

I didnâ€™t realise I was only buying one disc rotor. I thought it was a pair ðŸ¤”

## 28 February

Got the bottom bracket on, seat post and chain set in. Build now on hold until I change my flat mount disc calipers for post mount!

## 13 March

Delivery â€¦.. 7? Post mount (instead of flat mount) hydraulic disc brakes (the right ones)

Oh, and a medium caged rear mech, which is apparently what you need when you decide to run an 11-32 rear cassette

## 20 March

Forks, handlebars and wheels on! Starting to like the look of this bike ðŸ˜€

Scary cutting the carbon forks but seemed to get it right. Next step - brakes and gears!

## 22nd March

Last couple of days Iâ€™ve got the disc brakes and rear derailleur connected. Going to get my local bike shop to shorten and neaten the cables though

## 28th March

Cabling tidied up (and itâ€™s outside!) thanks to LBS. Just the bar tape to do now.

## 3rd April

The results are in. Rode this beauty on Sunday and itâ€™s great.

Total build cost: Just a smidge over Â£1900.

Reilly cycles just released a bike of the same spec for Â£2900

I think Iâ€™m winning.

And finally some pictures. And yeah, thatâ€™s right - my handlebars have my name

## 16th April

With the help of my dadâ€™s luggage weighing machine (and a yoga strap), I finally got round to weighing my bike.

9.56kg. Not bad for a hydraulic disc brake wielding machine.

## Instagram Post - 28th March

So here we have it. The build of the year.

I introduce to you the STREET HurracÃ¡n

- @planetxbikes titanium frame
- @huntbikewheels 4 season wheels
- @rideshimano 105 hydraulic disc groupset
- (Soon to be) tubeless wheels
- Blood, sweat and tears (literally all three)

My slight irk is the grip tape colour. But itâ€™s really good grip tape that was given to me for free so shh.
Many thanks to al those that helped me build this beauty. Canâ€™t wait to ride it proper.
