The table below details what I've been listening to, what I am listening to, or albums I've discovered. There is no shame in this list, these are things you'll catch me listening to. They are albums I reach for when wanting something comfortable.

I'm always open to recommendations, so let me know if there should be something added to this list.

I go through phases of _really_ liking an album, searching for it _every time_ I open Spotify and then, a month later, never listening to it again and forgetting about it. With Spotify and the wealth of music available, I feel I latch on as I'm too afraid to venture out.

I thought I would make a note here of the albums I hit hard so I can revisit at some point.
