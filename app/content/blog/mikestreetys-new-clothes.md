<p>For regular readers, you will notice a fresh new face on the old dog (my first blog post that made the many migrations <a href="{entry:116@1:url}">was from 2009</a>!). This has been a long time coming and is a continuation of an actual theme/consistent design I'm beginning to use across all my projects.</p>
<p>For those interested, the site is running on <a href="https://craftcms.com/">Craft CMS</a>, using <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">Laravel Mix</a> to compile the SCSS & JS. If you're visiting this site on an older browser, you may not see the colours (or much CSS at all) as I&nbsp;am using (and retaining) the CSS Variables (custom properties). Looking at my analytics, I can see the visitors are mainly in Chrome/Firefox (I&nbsp;assume mainly developers are visiting) so I&nbsp;made the call to keep these in place and benefit from their flexibility.</p>
<p>With Craft CMS you can have man "Channels", which is exactly what this blog, the Weeknotes and Projects are utilising. Having built <a href="https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/">Behind the Source</a> in between the original carnation of this Craft CMS blog and this version, I&nbsp;learned a lot about structuring the project and templates, so I&nbsp;took the opportunity to backup the database and files and re-build and restructure locally, before pushing live.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;A walk down memory lane</h3>
<p>With this recent update to my site, I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would revisit previous CMS's and (if I&nbsp;can find them) reskins of my site!</p>
<ul><li><strong>June 2010 </strong>-&nbsp;<strong></strong>I&nbsp;started my web presence as <strong>mikestreetmedia</strong>. The site was built with static pages (except for the Wordpress powered blog) and I was trying to build up my internet reputation<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613231449/http://www.mikestreetmedia.com/"><br>View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>February&nbsp;2011&nbsp;</strong> -&nbsp;mikestreetmedia didn't last long (I&nbsp;had the domain name for free for a year) so&nbsp;<strong>mikestreety&nbsp;</strong>was born (yes, I&nbsp;have owned the domain name for <a href="https://who.is/whois/mikestreety.co.uk">10 years</a>)<strong></strong>. As for the site, it was the same but&nbsp;got a reskin, and apparently I&nbsp;thought the more social networks you were on, the better.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110210184427/http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/">View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>September 2011</strong> - That site didn't last long (I&nbsp;had a lot of time on my hands) and I&nbsp;reduced the site to a single page, with links to my Twitter, Skype, Email and LinkedIn. That was it. Unfortunately,&nbsp;the internet archive didn't cache the CSS, so the full effect of the site isn't available.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>January 2012</strong> - Apparently, I&nbsp;couldn't stand not having a blog<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>so&nbsp;4 months later, once again, my site changed. This time, I went for the "nude" site approach - blogging and posting on a naked site in a bit to force me to write some CSS for it<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120128142942/http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/2012/01/whats-up-blog/"><br>View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>July 2012&nbsp;</strong> - It looked like I&nbsp;had added some colour by now, but obviously having a skinny site did nothing for encouraging working on my own site.&nbsp; In 2012 I&nbsp;was promoted at work and spent a lot of my spare time either working on side-projects or not wanting to be looking at a computer at all. Productivity on my site dwindled.<br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701214058/http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/">View on Internet Archive</a><strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>February&nbsp;2013 </strong>- In February 2013 I decided to remove the Wordpress site and move purely to blogging on <a href="https://anchorcms.com/">AnchorCMS</a>. I&nbsp;decided not to migrate my Wordpress posts, but instead <a href="{entry:8@1:url}">start again</a>.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520231347/http://mikestreety.co.uk/"><br>View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>July 2014</strong> - For a year or so I&nbsp;stuck with AnchorCMS themes until I started looking for new job. I figured as a front-end developer I should have a site which was actually coded by me, which was when the new theme came in<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140730224035/http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/"><br>View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>April 2016</strong> - That theme stuck around for a while (although evolved somewhat), but in 2016 I&nbsp;changed the CMS that powered my blog to Craft. With the change to Craft I&nbsp;re-imported all of my old Wordpress blogs (more for prosperity then actual content as a lot were out of date). I also wanted to make my blog more personal so I&nbsp;added a bit of info about me and a photo on the homepage.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221073903/https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/"><br>View on Internet Archive<br></a></li><li><strong>October 2017</strong> - This was when the homepage got closer to how it is today, with my face in a circle and the short bio still there. In this version I got rid of the projects and combined the local/remote blogs posts into one list. This variation was the one that was replaced this weekend&nbsp;(albeit with some optimisation &&nbsp;performance tweaks).<strong><br></strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022190215/https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/">View on Internet Archive</a><strong></strong><br><strong></strong></li></ul>
