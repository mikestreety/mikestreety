[TYPO3 Developer Days](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/) is taking place in Germany over the next few days. As I attend each talk, I've been writing bullet points in my notebook of noteworthy things, things I agree with, things to remember or things to look up later.

The following post is those bullet points in a digital format. They probably won't make sense to anyone, but serve as a nudge for future me and stop them from living and dying in my notebook. They are also my twist and interpretation of what was said - some of it is verbatim, but other notes are what I took from it.

- Generative AI in a CMS
	- Content generation
	- Coding
	- Translating
- Headless separates content from design
- Structured and semantic content is key
- Get your content straight and then let AI do the heavy lifting of editing, optimising & translating
- TYPO3 Content blocks
	- Currently an extension but will be in the core in v13
- TYPO3 SurfCamp built a website with site sets
	- https://github.com/typo3incubator
- TYPO3 have a11y tests in the pipeline - look into this
- TYPO3 are extending the LTS by 2 months (from v13)

## Migrating from jQuery - Core Journey to Vanilla JS - Andreas Nedbal

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/migrating-from-jquery-core-journey-to-vanilla-js-775) / [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/migrating-from-jquery-core-journey-to-vanilla-js/270669719) / Video (tbc)

- `$` replace with `documentQuerySelector(All)`
- `attr` with `getAttribute`/`setAttribute`
- `.data('*')` - use regex to replace with `.datatset.$1`
- Native DOM API has no chaining of methods
- `closest` exists in native JS too
- `new RegularEvent('change', function() {}).delegateTo` ([ref](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/Events/JavaScript/Index.html))
- TYPO3 Backend JS has it's own `AjaxResponse` class to use instead of `$.ajax`
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/)/LitElements is a wrapper library for web components which is helpful for building dynamic HTML
- Firefox restricts JS to the frame (Webkit ignores this)

## Settings and Configuration Management - Benjamin Franzke

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/settings-and-configuration-management-810) / [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11H_FuNmwV-PXeo6AXqBpRSHaw9ANvwZhKjPah830WcY/edit) / Video (tbc)

- All settings should have a default
- **Site Sets** - `Configuration/Sets/[SET NAME]`
	- Settings, TypoScript * TSConfig
	- Shareable
- `Configuration/Sets/*/config.yaml`
	- Should have a `name` and `label`
- In TYPO3 -> Edit Site Config -> "Sets for this site"
- Site Sets can inherit other site sets
- `settings.yaml` is available in v12 inside the `config/sites` folder
	- This was then replicated in a site set to centralise settings & allow to be shared
- Settings are rendered as if they were in `constants.typoscript`
	- Can access them in TypoScript and Fluid
	- There is also a new method/attribute on a site config (`getSettings()`)
- Any `setup.typoscript` and `page.tsconfig` inside the site set folder will be loaded automatically
- Site sets are a at a site level (can't load on individual pages)
- Once using site sets - remove the TYpoScript include (E.g. `EXT:form/Configuration/TypoScript/setup`) and, instead, import the site set
	- Encourage ext authors to use site sets
- No more db changes are needed (e.g. `sys_template`)
- Sit settings also replace `constants.typoscript` (although still compatible)

## TYPO3 Agencies and AI: An Experience Report - Fabian Stein

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/typo3-agencies-and-ai-an-experience-report-764) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- AI is seen as boring, disruptive and as an uncertainty
- AI will not replace people in the short/mid-term
- Clients are highly interested in AI, but they don't know how to use it
- Use cases
	- Getting information (e.g. FAQs)
	- Help with text editing
	- Generating stock images
- How can we support use of AI?
	- Tell success stories
	- Workshops - give people time to understand
	- Offer guidance
- AI is change, and change is scary
- RAG Workflow
	- Advantages
		- Easy to update
		- Easy to change
		- Many opportunities to use it
	- Disadvantages
		- Difficult to set up
		- Still can generate wrong answers
- Open Source LLMs
	- Lama 3.1 (still needs a lot of resources)
- [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/)
	- [OpenGPT-x](https://opengpt-x.de/en/)
		- Although no public progress since September last year


## Testing with Doubles: Why, When, and How? - Sebastian Bergmann

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/testing-with-doubles-why-when-and-how-777) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

This was a more practical talk that went a little over my head, hence the small notes

- Testing double is like a stunt double
	- Saves money as your double replaces "expensive" calls
- Terms
	- Dummy object - no methods
	- Test stub - object & methods
	- Test Spy - keeps track of which methods and properties called
	- Mock object - expect X to be called Y times
- Test stub
	- Looks like a real object
	- Can be configured to return a value or throw exception
- Mock object
	- Looks like a real object
	- Can accept messages
	- Test communications between objects
- PHP makes mock objects dynamic
	- E.g. with `createStub`
- PHPStan reads certain comments (e.g. `@template`) to better testing - also this helps with IDE hinting
- Never mock what isn't yours

## Time Management for Developers - Rachel Foucard

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/time-management-for-developers-794) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- Perception
	- Rachel told the story of [rocks in a jar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgMeKfQFq8)
	- Detect when something is good enough
		- You can add more value by focusing on more features, rather than whittling something to perfection
	- Past / Present / Future -> Not Now / Now / Not Now -> Done / In Progress / To Do
	- Days are routine which can help you synchronise with others but sometimes feel like they are running away from you
	- [Social Acceleration](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/social-acceleration/9780231148344)
		- Technical (e.g. sending an email instead of a letter)
		- Social Change (e.g. postal workers losing jobs because of email)
		- Pace of Life (e.g. instantaneous communication instead of waiting for a letter)
- Synchronisation
	- Meetings!
	- Use the same tools to plan your personal life as you do your professional life
- Tools
	- Mandatory tools are ones your stakeholders/company use
	- Personal tools are the ones you prefer
	- The best tool is the one that you use regularly
	- If a task is less than 5 minutes, don't add it to your To Do, do it now
	- Personal To do lists should be: Update -> Watch -> Update -> Watch (etc)
		- Should look at your to do list at least 3 times a day
	- Synchronous tools (e.g. PM tools) should follow the same pattern but be looked at daily
- Anticipation
	- Executing the task before time
	- Forseeing tasks
	- Emergency vs Priority is Fast vs First
	- Never plan 5 days of work a week - it doesn't exist
	- **Track your time** - not just for your company but for you, see where your time goes and it gives you better estimations
