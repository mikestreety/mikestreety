## Our quest for ACL improvements in TYPO3 Core - Tomasz Woldański

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/our-quest-for-acl-improvements-in-typo3-core-798) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- No change for TYPO3 user permissions over the last few years
- Lots of little things can make a big difference
- [Survey results](https://typo3.org/article/initial-phase-of-the-acl-enhancement-initiative)
	- Missing best practices
	- Complex UI/UX
	- Deployable permissions
- Best practices
	- Avoid setting permissions on a user
	- Have a login for every user (no sharing)
	- Create a different BE User group for each category/role
		- System: User groups for file & database mounts
		- ACL: Content & page permissions
		- Role: No permissions per se, but inherits from all the others
- [Documentation was updated](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/tutorial-getting-started/main/en-us/PermissionsManagement/Index.html)
- Addition of creating BE user group on initial site setup (v13.1)
- Addition of CLI commands to create predefined user groups
- UX Improvements for ACL
	- Split record & modal permissions into different tabs
	- Combined Access with User permissions
	- Searchable fields in the exclude fields permissions
	- Combined read & write (view & modify) permissions into a nicer table
	- Can add & edit users in a when editing the group
- Extension presets - predefine different roles & permissions in your extension to be loaded
- Deployable permissions most likely to be v14

## Innovating Integration: A Case Study on B2B with TYPO3 Headless - Łukasz Uznański

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/innovating-integration-a-case-study-on-b2b-with-typo3-headless-788) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

Because this was a case study, it was demonstrating what was achieved so there weren't too many notes.

- Improved their sales process - used TYPO3 as a content hub
- Vue.js frontend and using TYPO3 headless
- Choose the right tool for the job
- Vue front end pulls in different data from different services
- Nuxt - authenticates with TYPO3 which then connects to Magento
- Only Magento UID & user group is stored - this allows restricting of content & showing different promotions to different groups - also helps with GDPR


## Language Overlay - How it works - Benni Mack

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/language-overlay-how-it-works-813) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- Overlays are used for languages & workspaces
- Context API has language and workspace state/aspect
- Language - started as TypoScript but is now a single source of truth in the site config which can be used in FE and BE. This contains all the language config
- `l10n_parent` field is used everywhere for localisation config, except `tt_content` which uses `i18n_parent`
- When loading a different language, the default lang record is loaded and then the translation - all the fields are then replaced except the `uid`. The UID of the translated page is put into `_OVERLAY_UID`
- If no translation is found, the fallback chain is referred to
- Overlay replaces all the data except the UID because:
	- All links point to the default language
	- PID is always the default language
- Fallbacks are essentially overlays but in the other direction
- Workspaces
	- `t3ver_wsid` - What workspace is this?
	- `t3ver_oid` - The ID of the original/online/live page
	- `t3ver_state` - Is this a change/deletion/addition
- When viewing the FE of a workspace, every content & page record is checked for a workspace overlay
	- If a version is found, every field is replaced except PID and UID
- When loading a language in a workspace, several hops are made:
	1. Live, Default lang
	2. Versioned (workspaced), Default lang
  	3. Live, translated version
  	4. Versioned, translated version
- Why is it complicated?
	- Historical reasons
	- No better solution
	- TYPO3 are trying to make it less complicated
	- Keeps the sorting & position accross translations
	- In an ideal world, overlays and `sys_language_uid` wouldn't be needed
	- Saves space (instead of duplicating the DB, only needed records are made)
		- But does mean more queries
- Just use the APIs
- `PageRepository` has uses the `Context` API
	- Access Workspace & Language overlays in FE
- `cObj` uses `PageRepository`
- `PageRepository` has plenty of PSR-14 events to use
- `BackendUtility` for getting Workspace and Language overlays in BE
- You _can_ use `PageRepository` in the BE
- `RelationHandler` to read & write related DBs
- Use `DataHandler` for writing
- You always need a default language, but can use the "Hide default language of a page" checkbox in page properties

## The SAST and the furious - Zack Lott

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/the-sast-and-the-furious-785) / [Slides](https://slack-files.com/T024TUMLZ-F07F29C3JLE-a6f5edb68b) / Video (tbc)

- Application security
	- Testing security features
	- Prevents users from doing unauthorised actions
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- Normal methods for finding security issues
	- Code reviews
	- Previous experience
	- Own Tools
	- Security tools
- SAST Scanners
	- Analyse your code, like PHPStan
- Can run during development locally or on CI
- Doesn't require infrastructure like database
- Lean on the experts to find issues with predefined rules
- [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)
	- Open source
	- PHP & JS
	- Custom rules
	- Integrate pipelines & run locally
	- Has a library of rules
	- `brew install semgrep`
- Supply chain attacks
	- Targets third party vendors (e.g. Crowdstrike)
- Do you know your dependencies & sub dependencies and if they have CVEs?
- [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/)
	- Scans NPM, Composer, APT & APK and OS
	- Will identify common CVE
	- Local scanning on computer or server
	- Scan against a repo
	- Scan docker images
	- `brew install trivy`
- Gitlab requires setting up with YAML, Github you can "add" it
- Semgrep and Trivy export JSON, SARIF
- SBOMs list all your dependencies and are sometimes requested

## TYPO3-Rector v2 - Henrik Elsner

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/typo3-rector-v2-758) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- Upgrades are long and expensive
- Any problem that arises after an upgrade is always a problem of the upgrade
- Rector
	- Migrate TYPO3 TCA
	- Classes/Extbase/Icons PHP
	- TypoScript/YAML/Fluid
	- Will also tell you what it can't do automatically
- Benefits
	- More time for testing
	- Learn changes you didn't know
	- More efficient
	- Keeps knowledge which gets lost
- [Typo3 Rector](https://github.com/sabbelasichon/typo3-rector) is a wrapper for [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector)
- Trust Rector
	- Each rule has tests
	- Dry run on the first run
	- Rector detects the class and ensures the methods are ok (unlike scanner in TYPO3)
	- Treat Rector like a junior employee - not a senior
- Best practice
	- Clean up your files first (delete unused code)
	- Run Rector for the current version you are on
		- E.g. if you are doing 11 -> 12, run it for 11 first to ensure you are up-to-date
	- Run the latest rector first (v2) then run v1 to catch old rules - then run v2 again in case any rule got updated
- Tips
	- For TCA it needs a `ctrl` and `columns` array keys
	- For selects it needs `'type' => 'select'` - even in a TCA override
- [Fractor](https://github.com/andreaswolf/fractor) for files
- Consider running Rector in CI to prevent old code from being copied/used

## Securing TYPO3 Web Applications - Oliver Hader

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/securing-typo3-web-applications-811) / Slides (tbc) / Video (tbc)

- **XSS**
	- Allow injection of JS
	- Can lead to remote controlling (e.g. key logger or crypto miner)
	- [Different types](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting)
	- Protect against SVG uploads
- `GET` Param
	- `htmlspecialchars`
	- `json_encode`
- TYPO3
	- `<f:format.raw>` and `<f:format.htmlentitiesDecode>` do not sanitise
	- Use `<f:format.html>` or `<f:sanitize.html>` instead
- Be aware of securing your JS files (outside of TYPO3)
- Encode HTML and JSON
- Use HTML sanitiser (`lib.parseFunc`)
- Use SVG sanitiser for uploaded files
- Apply a Content Secruity Policy
- Introduce [Trusted Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) in your JS
- **SQL Injection**
	- Allows injection of SQL
	- Could lead to leaking of sensitive data
- `sqlmap` - Runs common SQL injection commands
- Create named parameters when interacting with the DB
- Use prepared statements
- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR)**
	- Manipulate/retrieve internal resources by knowing identifiers
	- E.g. UIDs, filenames etc
- Ensure different values can't be used (i.e. changing an ID in a "update" form)
- **Cross-site Request Forgery**
	- Tricked into visiting a malicious website
	- Use `strict` cookies where possible
	- `lax` is still a bit stricter than `none`
	- Dissallow GET method for actions (e.g. creation & deletion)
	- Use CSRF tokens where possible
	- Enable "Enforce referrer" in TYPO3
- File upload
	- Could allow remote code execution
	- Give you a bad site reputation
	- Could allow information disclosure
- Checks on file uploads
	- File size
	- File extension
	- Mime type
	- Mime type matches file extension

## The Art of Deployment - Martin Helmich

[T3DD Schedule Link](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/de/programm/sessions/the-art-of-deployment-780) / [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/martinhelmich/t3dd24-the-art-of-deployment) / Video (tbc)

- Deployment evolution
	- FTP
	- FileZilla
	- Rsync
	- Version Control (e.g. `git pull` on live server)
	- Atomic deployments
- Deployments should be repeatable and automatable
- Deployments should not cause downtime
- Deployments should be reversible
- There is already Gitlab & TYPO3 [deployment configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates/typo3-distribution)
- Atomic Deployments
	- TYPO3 Surf
	- PHP Deployer
- Code is straight-forward to deploy
- Database is harder as it is more difficult to rollback - your app needs to be compatible with both version of the DB
- Automated deployments need quality control
	- Testing (PHPUnit, Jest)
	- Coding Style (CSFixer, Code Sniffer)
	- Type Checking (PHPStan, PSALM)
- Containers remove environment disparity
- Helm is deployment for Kubernetes
- MACH
	- Microservices
	- API first
	- Cloud Native
	- Headless
		- Microservices create more deployment services
		- Which order do you release?
- Dark launching
	- Launching code behind a feature flag
	- doesn't matter which order you deploy as you enable the feature after deployment
- [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) - an open source feature flag service
	- It's what Gitlab uses under the hood
- [openfeature.dev](https://openfeature.dev/)
