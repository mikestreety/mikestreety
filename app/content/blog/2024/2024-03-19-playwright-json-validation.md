Chase Jarvis once said "the best camera is the one that is with you" and I often apply this to other parts of my life. Playwright might not be [the best tool](https://json-schema.org/implementations) to validate JSON with, but if you are already using it and have it set up, then it is better than loading a whole new framework or tool.

This post will walk through calling a JSON API and validating it against a predefined [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). This will flag if the JSON output changes - which might impact users using the API (or your own internal calls to the endpoint).

<div class="info">This post assumes you are already familiar with Playwright and have it set up. The examples will be using <strong>TypeScript</strong></div>

## Installation

For this test we are going to be using [Ajv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv) - a JSON schema validator.

The following installs it as a dev dependency:

```
npm i ajv -D --save
```

## Generate Schema

The trickiest bit of this is actually generating the schema for the test to check against. There are several tools online - the thing to be careful is to ensure your schema uses the `draft-07` definition - as this is the most recent, stable, release.

For this example, I'll be using the [JSON output](https://alehouse.rocks/api/beers.json) from my [beer blog](https://alehouse.rocks/) - you are more than welcome to use as a sample.

The best tool I've found is by [Itential - JSON to Schema](https://json-to-schema.itential.io/). You paste your JSON output on the left and let it generate the Schema - you can then "Edit" and specify extra properties if desired. Another tool I've used is from [transform](https://transform.tools/json-to-json-schema).

This was the Schema generated for my beers API and I've saved this in my tests folder as `beers.schema.json` - the filename doesn't matter, but it helps to be consistent.

```json
{
  "$id": "root",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "number": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "title": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "image": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "thumbnail": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "brewery": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "rating": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "date": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "breweries": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "title": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "slug": {
              "type": "string",
            }
          },
          "required": [
            "title",
            "slug"
          ],
          "additionalProperties": true
        }
      },
      "slug": {
        "type": "string",
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "number",
      "title",
      "image",
      "thumbnail",
      "brewery",
      "rating",
      "date",
      "breweries",
      "slug"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": true
  }
}
```

## Create the Test

The bit you've been waiting for - the test! It might be worth considering setting up a specific `project` for API tests - as you don't need to validate the API schema in many browsers.

The following test is located next to `beers.schema.json` - if the paths differ, then update the path inside the `require`

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import Ajv from 'ajv';

/**
 * @description API JSON Validation
 */
test.describe('JSON Tests', () => {
  // Initialise AJV
  const ajv = new Ajv();

  /**
   * @description Validate Beers JSON
   */
  test('Beers', async ({ request }) => {
	// Load the beer JSON URL
    const response = await (await request.get('https://alehouse.rocks/api/beers.json')).json();

	// Validate the response against the schema file
    const valid = ajv.validate(require('./beers.schema.json'), response);

	// Output the errors text
    if (!valid) {
      console.error('AJV Validation Errors:', ajv.errorsText());
    }

	// If the JSON is valid, the variable is "true"
    expect(valid).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Hopefully, if you've used the examples above, the test should pass with flying colours. You can verify that it isn't a false positive by changing any of the `string` types to `integer` in the `.schema.json` and Playwright will fail.

The output from AJV isn't the prettiest, but are output both on the command line (starting with `AJV Validation Errors:`) and attached to the report under `stderr`.

## Bonus: Validate a JSON linked from the initial response

It may be your initial JSON request has dynamic links to a separate JSON response you wish to validate - to do this, you can operate an additional `request.get` inside your test.

E.g. If your first JSON API response was like the following:

```json
[{
	"link": "https://example.com/api/extra-url-with-date-2024-03-19"
}]
```

You can do the following inside your test:

```typescript
const initialResponse = await (await request.get('https://example.com/api/')).json();

const response = await request.get(initialResponse[0].link);
const responseData = await response.json();
```

You can then validate `responseData` against your schema.
