intro: I found this in an old recipe book I found in a charity shop. Not quite sure what happened to it, but I've tweaked the recipe and named it after my wife!

Great dip to go with anything including crisps, burgers or anything else you can dip!

**Ingredients:**

- 6 tomatoes - peeled and finely chopped
- 1 small onion - finely chopped
- 1 sweet red pepper - finely chopped
- 100ml wine vinegar
- 100g caster sugar
- 1 tsp salt

**Method:**

Chuck everything in a saucepan until it’s reduced - normally for about half an hour. Does about a jars worth which keeps in the fridge. Best when the tomatoes aren’t too juicy or if they are, tip the juice away before putting in the saucepan.

Chillis can be added for a bit of heat if desired.
