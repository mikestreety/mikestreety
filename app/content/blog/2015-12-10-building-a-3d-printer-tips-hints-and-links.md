Recently a friend, Chris, and I have embarked on the journey of building our own 3D printer. This is something I hugely recommend if you are into that kind of thing. It's taught me many things already and is amazing to see something moving that you've built. I'm in no way a mechanic, so this the kit car equivalent in my world.

This post isn't going to walk you though how to build a 3D printer, but is rather a collection of some tips and tricks we've learnt during the process, along with some links which have helped us understand. Think of it as your friend who has build a printer already, and is just sharing some knowledge to help you out.

The printer we have built/are building is the [RepRap Prusa Mendal - (Iteration 2)](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)).

### Hints

Just some things to note if you are embarking on this journey. If you have something to add, [tweet me](http://www.twitter.com/mikestreety)!

- It takes longer than you think (_a lot_ longer)
- A 3D printer is never finished, it just gets to a state of "being"
- You'll always find something to upgrade - so save your pennies
- Don't be too precious - you'll rebuild every bit of it at some point
- If you have a local hackspace/makerspace (like [Build Brighonton](http://www.buildbrighton.com/)) become a member and go - there will be people to help and tools to use - there is a handy [list of makerspaces](http://www.hackspace.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page)
- No two printers are the same - yours will _look_ like another, but work differently (or you might pick up slightly different parts)

### Links

Many hours of research have led me to this point, you will probably want to do your own research, but these links have helped immensely.

#### Building

For building the printer, these two guides were hugely helpful:

**[The official RepRap guide](http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_Assembly_(iteration_2))** - Big thanks to Neil Underwood for the videos!

**[Next day RepRap](http://www.nextdayreprap.co.uk/prusa-mendel-build-manual-contents/)** - Despite the name, it's hard to have a RepRap "next day"
