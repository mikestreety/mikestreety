<h3>Black lives matter</h3>
<p>This week in America, riots and protests have happened across the country (and world) after the <s>death</s> murder of an unarmed Black man by a white police officer. It has really made me check my privilege and I am making sure I am educating myself on racism and how I can be a better ally.</p>

<h3>Behind the Source on Pause</h3>
<p>With the events in America, it felt wrong to publish a Behind the Source interview this week. I have put the publishing on hold for the time being. </p>
<h3>I was on a podcast</h3>
<p>Si Jobling, who hosts the Make Life Work podcast hosted me as a guest this week. It was the first podcast i've ever been on and have had some good feedback. You can listen to it on all good podcast publishers <a href="https://sijobling.com/podcast/mike-street/">or on Si's website.</a></p>
<h3>Tech Stuff</h3><p><strong>Lighthouse 6</strong> has been keeping me busy the last couple of weeks. It was released on 19th May and I have spent the last few days correcting scores of our clients.</p><p><strong>Gulp</strong> is starting to slow me down and cause issues on our larger sites, so I'm starting to look at alternatives. Despite the name, I use <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">Laravel Mix</a> on my personal projects that use Craft, but our work projects are a lot more complex. Webpack seems the obvious answer (we already use it for JS) but it is hell of a dog to set up and understand.</p><p>I want to give a big shout-out to <a href="https://pasteapp.io/"><strong>Paste</strong></a>. An amazing app that I use daily.</p><p><strong></strong></p>
