Been a few weeks since my last notes & I've been collating a few points (and trying to find the time to actually flesh out the notes..)

My [posting schedule](/blog/my-2021-writing-schedule/) is full steam ahead. For a little while I've had posts up until July! I figured that is far enough in the future for now and so I am peppering additional posts in between (a lot can happen to a site in a few months!)

Since converting my site to 11ty, I've been finding opportunities for new 11ty sites everywhere. Just the other day I was talking to a friend about having a site with his YouTube videos on and within a few hours I had a prototype up and running by using an [RSS feed](/blog/create-11ty-collection-from-rss/).

As mentioned in my [last note](/blog/notes-11), I've been listening to the [Working Code](https://workingcode.dev/) podcast and with each episode, it just gets better and better.

A few weeks ago in [Episode 13](https://workingcode.dev/episodes/013-do-what-you-love-and-youll-never-work-a-day-in-your-life/), one of the hosts, Ben, shared a poem which really resonated with me. I'm not normally a poem guy but I was listening to it the day after I published my post about [Imposter Syndrome](/blog/side-project-imposter-syndrome/) and this one from [Marianne Williamson](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson) really resonated with me:

> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br>
> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>
> It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.<br>
> We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?<br>
> Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
> You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>
> There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you.<br>
> We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br>
>  We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.<br>
> It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same.<br>
> As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

In the episode I listened to today ([Episode 15](https://workingcode.dev/episodes/015-potluck-1/)), it was mentioned about "building as you climb". To paraphrase, As you solve a problem, once you cross the ravine, build a bride so the person that follows you can go farther than you. This reminded me of my post about [delegation](/blog/making-sure-youre-not-doing-everything-at-work) in which I said

> you should train your team to be as good as you, and then push them to be better
