<p>So like my good friends <a href="http://mrqwest.co.uk/blog/230/blog-post-amnesty">Anthony</a> and <a href="http://simianstudios.com/blog/post/blog-post-amnesty">Kris</a>, I've realised how <em>little</em> i've blogged over the last year. Looking at my <a href="https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/wordpress-pulling-an-archive">archive</a> the last 6 months of 2012 played host to just 1 blog post. That is terrible.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to try to do is blog at least once a month. When the glorious year of 2013 is over, I want 12 blog posts to my name (this one doesn't count). If I end up with more, thats brilliant. Any less and I'll seriously consider why i'm blogging in the first place</p>
<p>To help me and to give me motivation, I've installed a new CMS (which lets me write in markdown) and I've <a href="https://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/wordpress-pulling-an-archive">archived</a> all of my old blog posts. Wordpress was clunky and too much for what I needed - <a href="http://anchorcms.com/">Anchor CMS</a> however is clean, simple and just a blog (but you can make pages too). Not having the old blog posts there to buffer, means I'll (hopefully) be more motivated to post.</p>
<p>What I've done with my own Wordpress posts is export them, create a new table in the Anchor CMS database and looped through them on the Archive page for reference. I'm tempted to put a key at the top, so you can jump to the post. I'll make a blog post about how I did that (simple PHP & <em>very</em> basic MySQL)</p>
