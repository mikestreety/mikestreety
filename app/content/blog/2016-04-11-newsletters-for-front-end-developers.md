There is so much information on the web these days about development, that I often miss out on things on twitter. For that reason, I find HTML newsletters amazingly simple but wonderfully nutritional for my front-end developer brain.

Below is a list of newsletters I subscribe too. I don't read every single article in every single newsletter, but if a link appears a couple of times across a few I'll start to take note (I also easily get distracted at the promise of fancy animations or cool effects).

If you have any suggestions for newsletters to subscribe to - [drop me a tweet](https://twitter.com/mikestreety) and i'll add it to the list!
