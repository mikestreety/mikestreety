<p>A little while ago, Evans Cycles blogged <a href="http://blog.evanscycles.com/other_stuff/10-moments-every-cyclist-hates/">10 Moments Every Cyclist Hates</a> and before I had even read the blog, plenty of moments popped into my head - but none of them were mentioned! Here are my top 10.</p>
<h4>10) When you don't head out on the Bike as you're not in the mood, then you regret it later in the day</h4>
<p>When you wake up, its a little bit cloudy and you love the cocoon of the mattress so decide to stay in. Later on you are then itching to go out - but you have plans!</p>
<h4>9) When you don't know what to wear</h4>
<p>Is it going to be hot? Windy? Cold? Raining? Longs? Shorts? Arms? Fingers? Finger-less?</p>
<h4>8) When you take your lid off, and have to put it back on with sweaty pads</h4>
<p>I sometimes go out for a pre-ride work, cycling to work means I have to put a sweaty helmet back on.</p>
<h4>7) When you catch someone up going downhill, but don't quite have the speed or space to overtake</h4>
<p>Touching the brakes, not quite getting terminal velocity and not quite getting your fastest time</p>
<h4>6) When your steed starts squeaking or rattling</h4>
<p>You either put up with it or pull over every 5 minutes trying to work out where its coming from</p>
<h4>5) Cars & Traffic</h4>
<p>They get in the way don't they? Cutting up, pulling out, going too slow (see 7 or 3). Also that moment when you overtake a bus, to then get overtaken, to overtake again...</p>
<h4>4) When you give it all you've got but its not...</h4>
<p>When you sprint and try so hard to get your best time, but it only comes up 3rd best on Strava...</p>
<h4>3) When you build up momentum to attack a hill and have to slow down due to someone else</h4>
<p>Starting up your legs again is a killer!</p>
<h4>2) When you drop your chain - especially on a climb</h4>
<p>Having your chain drop in the middle of an ascent is the worst way to stop - especially if you're clipped in</p>
<h4>1) When you pull away but can't get your second clip in</h4>
<p>Trying and trying, but it just won't go - especially a nightmare when its a hill!</p>
