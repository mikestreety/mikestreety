<p>Last night was the second of my mini-conferences, <a href="http://www.pointsbrighton.co.uk">Points Brighton</a>. It featured speakers and keynotes of all different varieties, and the infamous Points Bazaar (the raffle) was, once more, a hit. If you want to see how good it looked, the photos can be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78206174@N02/sets/72157629656132734/">found on flickr</a>.</p>
