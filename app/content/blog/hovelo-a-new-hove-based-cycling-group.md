<p>Posts round here have been a bit quite because my time has been taken up by starting a new cycling club - <a href="https://www.hovelo.co.uk">Hovélo</a></p>
<p>Hovélo is a casual group of cyclists who enjoy biking but not the seriousness of proper bike clubs. Meeting every Sunday at the Small Batch on Goldstone Villas in Hove, the rides are whatever distance people turning up want. Generally, they end up being around 35-40 miles being back in Hove by 11.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you're thinking of coming along, hop over to the <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/hov%C3%A9lo-94708">Strava group</a>, introduce yourself and head out!&nbsp;</p>
