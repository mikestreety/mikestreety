<p>For the final year of my degree, I was required to create an Experimental System Design. At the time, I was heavily involved with a live version of&nbsp; The Red Attack which was&nbsp;my electronic music played with instruments rather than computers.</p>

<p>My set up consisted of an electric guitar running through Logic’s MainStage which was a theoretical amp. This allowed me to apply effects to the guitar sound, which would have been a very expensive pedal board!</p>







<p>To complement this set up, I wanted a method of altering the effect parameters while playing. &nbsp;I was after a hands-free method, which could be controlled with simple gestures of the guitar. That’s where the Wiimote steps in. Using <a href="http://www.osculator.net/">OSCulator</a>, I was able to access the accelerometers and motion sensors, convert them into MIDI using MAX/MSP, which was then taken into MainStage.</p>







<p>The Wiitar (Wiimote & Guitar) and Mainstage makes a brand new instrument, with a brand new way of playing. Its takes a while getting used to but it is worth it. Your playing will never be the same!</p>







<p>Now fully developed, the MAX patch is hugely versatile. It can be used by a singer, by a drummer or by a piano player. Any instrument or sound, which can be fed into MainStage, can be effected with the Wii remote.</p>







<p>The MAX/MSP patch, in reality, is just sending out MIDI messages, so the patch can be used with Cubase, Logic, Ableton or any other sequencer.</p>







<p>For my project I had to create an example video of it in use, below is that video. I apologise for the awful playing but you get the idea!</p>
