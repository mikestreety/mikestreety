I co-organise a mini-conference every year with people at work called [Bytes](https://www.bytesconf.co.uk/)â€‹. Last year in September I had the privilege of speaking. I spoke about a "digital bucket list" and how I think it's important that everyone should have side-projects and hobbies - whether they are web related or not. 

I've included the video and slides below for my talk, but a full write-up with links to all the videos and slides of the talks that evening can be found [on the Liquid Light blog](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/article/bytes-2016/).
