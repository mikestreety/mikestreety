<p><em>I’m not sure if this is a thing or just a pipe-dream but bear with me.</em></p>
<h3>I want to create an unbiased service, a factual hub where cyclists and drivers can understand the laws and rules of the road.</h3>
<p>Every day I see drivers showing no respect to cyclists, I see cyclists not caring for the highway code and I see arguments online of ill-informed people making sweeping generalisations about “bloody cyclists” or “all drivers”.</p>
<p>I want to make a site which provides information about everything to do with cycling and road use. What’s allowed, what’s legal, what’s advised. When arguments spark up I want a resource people can go to, to get the facts. I want to make it as unbiased as possible, offering both sides of the story and ultimately giving a final answer. No more “I heard this” or “I read that”.</p>
<p>It would link to official sources and each fact would require to be backed up by a reputable source. It would, what us developers call, a “single source of truth”. A central location of all things road.</p>
<p>I want it to be somewhere where drivers can go to learn about cyclists on the road, and cyclists can go to learn what they can and can’t do.</p>
<p>Some examples of issues addressed</p>
<ul><li>Cyclists don’t “pay road tax”</li><li>Cycle paths - why don’t they always get used?</li><li>How much space should you leave when overtaking?</li><li>Red lights - should cyclists have to stop?</li><li>Helmets - are they required?</li></ul>
<p>The site would be a wiki - community edited, community sourced, community maintained.</p>
<p>Is this something people would want? Would you be willing to help out? At the moment I'm just gauging interest. If I get enough interest I’ll look at getting this thing off the ground.</p>
