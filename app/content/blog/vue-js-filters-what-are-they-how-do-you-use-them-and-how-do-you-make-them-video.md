intro: There are many ways to manipulate a value to make it user-friendly using Vue.js. In this tutorial, I show you how you can use Vue filters to alter the appearance of a variable without affecting its data.

Using filters in Vue.js, you are able to manipulate the appearance of a variable without altering the actual value. This is done in the template by using the pipe (`|`) character. For example:

<pre class="language-js">{{ message | lowercase }}</pre>

To create this filter, add a `filters` object to the Vue or component instance. Within this, create a new function which accepts one parameter and returns a value:

<pre class="language-js"> new Vue({
	el: '#app',

	filters: {
		lowercase(val) {
			return val.toLowerCase();
		}
	},

	data: {
		message: 'Hello World'
	}
});</pre>

With the basics of filtering under your belt, we can progress onto slightly more advanced filtering - with a more practical example.

###Â VAT Calculator

A realistic example would be a VAT calculator. Wanting to use the percentage as a decimal (e.g. 20% = 0.2) but display in a user-friendly way, we can use filters to accomplish this.

The initial app JavaScript will look like the following:

<pre class="language-js">new Vue({
	el: '#app',

	data: {
		price: 0,
		vat: 0.2
	},

	computed: {
		amount() {
			let price = parseFloat(this.price),
				vat = price * this.vat;
			return price + vat;
		}
	}
});</pre>

Create the HTML to match the JS. This should have an input field bound to the `price` variable using `v-model`, the VAT rate output (`vat`) and the `amount` variable being output

<pre class="language-html">&lt;div id="app"&gt;
	Price ext vat: &lt;input v-model="price"&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Vat percent: {{ vat | percent }}&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Price with vat: {{ amount | currency }}&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

On both the `vat` and `amount` variables, add filters for `percent` and `currency` respectively.

The `percent` filter will convert a decimal to a percent - by multiplying the amount by 100 and then adding a **%** sign. 

The `currency` filter will use [toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString) to convert the number to a human-readable price.

Within the app JavaScript, create two the two new filters and their functionality:

<pre class="language-js">new Vue({
	el: '#app',

	filters: {
		percent(val) {
			return val * 100 + '%';
		},

		currency(val) {
			return val.toLocaleString('en-GB', {
				style: 'currency',
				currency: 'GBP'
			});
		}
	},

	data: {
		price: 80,
		vat: 0.2
	},

	computed: {
		amount() {
			let price = parseFloat(this.price),
				vat = price * this.vat;
			return price + vat;
		}
	}
});</pre>

The VAT and amount now read a lot better, without the original values be altered.

## Errata

A couple of differences/issues that have been pointed out/I've noticed with the video. Unfortunately, you can't re-upload Youtube videos and keep the same URL, so I will have to list them here:

### Initialising 

When initialising a Vue filter, you can either do it as described in the video, via an object on the Vue instance or component or, alternatively, you can use `vue-filter` - much as you would `vue-component`. An example of the percent one above would be:

<pre class="language-js">Vue.filter('percent', function(val) {
	return val * 100 + '%';
});</pre>

### Variables & arguments

In the video, I state that filters only accept one argument - this is incorrect and they can, in fact, accept many. A use case would be if you didn't want to hardcode the `GBP` in the currency filter, you could pass this is as an argument like so:

<pre class="language-html">&lt;h3&gt;Price with vat: {{ amount | currency('GBP') }}&lt;/h3&gt;</pre>

With the javascript being updated as you would expect:

<pre class="language-js">new Vue({
	el: '#app',

	filters: {
		percent(val) {
			return val * 100 + '%';
		},

		currency(val, currency) {
			return val.toLocaleString('en-GB', {
				style: 'currency',
				currency
			});
		}
	},

	...
});</pre>

_Using ES6, we do not need to specify `currency: currency` in the `toLocaleString` function._
