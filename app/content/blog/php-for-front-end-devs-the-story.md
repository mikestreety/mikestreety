<p>Recently, a few friends of mine have been asking questions about PHP and want to learn the basics. I am a front-end developer for a web design agency. i.e. I mainly stick to HTML/CSS and have colleagues who do the heavy PHP stuff. However, I think its handy for a front end dev to know the basics of PHP, as it speeds up development time and mean, for me, that i don't have to annoy the other guys every time i need a loop or something.</p>

<p>For that reason I am going to write a small series of Blog posts &nbsp;- #PHPFED. If you have any suggestions or any questions, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92fffbf9f7e1e6e0f7f7e6ebd2f5fff3fbfebcf1fdff">email</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mikestreety">tweet me</a>.</p>



<p>I am trying to combat the cliched tutorials that are out there and I'm going to try and provide code that is actually useful. I remember looking back for PHP tutorials and finding:</p>



<pre class="language-php">$a = 'Hello World';
echo $a; //Returns 'Hello World'</pre>





<p>Its all well and good, but it makes you think 'Why do I need that?'. The next step is normally database integration with some sort of complex code.</p>



<p>This series is aimed at beginners, who just want some really simple functions and instructions to make their lives happier, easier and simpler. I am by no means a PHP expert, but I know the basics enough to show someone else the basics.</p>



<p>With this series of tutorials, i assume you know basic HTML, CSS and have at least heard of PHP.</p>



<p>All code examples can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mikestreety/PHPFED">Github</a>&nbsp;and if&nbsp;you ever notice errors in the code, please let me know (or fork it) and I will correct it. Thanks.</p>
