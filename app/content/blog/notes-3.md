<h3>Lockdown continues</h3><p>I don't think I've mentioned this in blogs or notes before, but the UK is currently on lockdown. Since 18th March, Liquid Light have been a fully remote company - we had to quickly adapt to working in an office to all being in our own homes. It's a weird time, but I think the boy is enjoying both me and my wife being home. Despite the fact i'm not spending 2 hours a day commuting, I seem to have <em>less</em> time then I did before! It's going to be a hard shift when we're allowed to go back to the office again.<em></em></p><p>Thankfully we're allowed to go out an exercise - the bike rides scattered throughout the week are keeping me sane!</p><h3>Behind the source gets started</h3><p>It's been a long time coming, but <a href="https://www.behindthesource.co.uk/">Behind the Source</a> is finally going to be underway next week. Last week I announced who was going to be involved and when the interviews are going public. I'm super excited about these as they have been such a good read while I've been editing and inputting them into the CMS.</p><h3>Useful links<a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse-ci/viewer/"><br></a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse-ci/viewer/">Compare Google Lighthouse reports</a> - useful for a before/after report for a client when doing optimisations</li><li>I got caught out by the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/chrome-system-fonts-snafu/">Google Chrome font-weight issue</a> this week on my Beer site</li><li><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/">Google Meets is free</a> - this is a great tool we use at work for our meetings (while on lockdown), it's great to see Google opening it up to the public</li></ul>
