I've recently been playing around with Raspberry Pi and some hardware - seeing what else can be done with the tiny computer.

I previously wrote about using the pi as a [media centre](/blog/my-media-centre-solution), but I wanted to try something else (after seeing a friend using his for house temperature readings).

I've always wanted a basic weather station, one that just told me the temperature outside so that I knew what to wear for cycling, and this is what I set out to create.

This will be the first in a series of blogs posts detailing the steps i've been through. I've made a prototype, but I'm about to embark on making something proper and so I will be making a note of what I'm doing (for my sake as well as yours!)

### Getting Started

I already had my raspberry pi, but if you don't have one I would recommend getting (at time of writing) the B+ or (if you can spare the extra cash) a Raspberry Pi B 2 (the 2 being the important bit!)

I also picked up a [starter kit](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sintron-T-Cobbler-Extension-Starter-Raspberry/dp/B00KKW6NEA/) - although the documentation you get with it is appalling, it's good to have some starting hardware to use and call upon - then pick up the extra bits as when you need them.

### Useful Links

- [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/raspberry-pi) is a brilliant resource for learning
- [Ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk) are great places for picking up components
- [PiFace](http://www.piface.org.uk/) is also an excellent shop
- [Rapsberry Pi Spy](http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/) has got some great resources!

I'm also keeping track of the code i'm using

- [pypi-lcdscreen](https://github.com/mikestreety/pypi-lcdscreen) is my pip (python package manager) module for using an LCD screen (like the one found in the starter kit)
- [WeatherStation](https://gitlab.com/mikestreety/WeatherStation) - The code which runs and powers the weather station
