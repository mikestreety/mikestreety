<strong class="info">Update March 2021:</strong> Since this post, written in 2011, HTML and CSS have come a long way. The same effect can be achieved using a CSS selector such as `:last-child` or `:last-of-type`.


If you want to apply a different class to the last item in a list generated by PHP, start off with Setting the `$lastOne` variable to the end of your list

```php
$lastOne = end($your_array);
```

This stores the details of the last one in your list into the lastOne variable - we'll compare later.

You may need to modify your existing while/foreach loop, adding in the $i variable to your item. If i is already used, then pick any other letter.

```php
foreach ($your_array as $i => $item) {
```

Then on the list item or table row that you want to apply the last class to, compare your `$lastOne` with the current one your are looping through.

```html
<div class="box <?php echo ($lastOne == $item ? '  last' : '' ?>>
```
