<p>I didn't realise that my last blog post sounded so morbid. I didn't realise it sounded so dark.</p>

<p>I enjoy writing, I enjoy creative writing and so, I like to challenge myself. The is no message, no hidden words behind the text on the page. My writing process involves thinking of a topic, of a word and seeing what art my fingers draw on the canvas of the screen. Sometimes those words are lovely, other times they appear to be weighted with thoughts. The is never a hidden message with my posts - i'm not that clever.</p>
