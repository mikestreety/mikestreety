Imposter syndrome is prevalent in every industry, not least the web world. Many people who I respect and admire greatly have blogged about their own feelings of not belonging or not deserving of their place.

I have been fortunate enough to not have experienced imposter syndrome that much in my professional career. I appreciate my privilege no doubt played a huge role in that, but I've kept my head down and felt like I've worked hard to get where I am today.

I have experienced imposter syndrome more and more in my professional day-to-day life - especially since working my way up to director level. Having meetings with clients and appearing to be this well-travelled, experienced and seasoned professional really kicks you in the feels.

The one that gets me, the one that is a curve ball is the impostor syndrome experienced with my side projects. I recently spoke about it [on a podcast](https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/what-is-a-side-project-if-not-a-safe-place-to-get-imposter-syndrome/) and, since recording it, it has been playing on my mind - a lot.

I find it hard to self-promote and, even when I do, I don't have a lot of confidence in what I've written. It shows; every fortnight of 2021 I've published a new blog post but yet I've only tweeted links to my personal site twice this year. I don't trust the words i've written - especially technical posts. I've been a professional developer (albeit I've been paid to develop websites) for 12 years - but I still don't believe in my abilities.

Throughout February and March, I recorded 6 episodes of a [podcast series](https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/). I didn't blog about it, I didn't tweet about it, I didn't even tell my family. Every week that podcast went out I felt embarrassed and a fraud - who am I to have the authority to speak on a _podcast_?

It's such a weird and tricky feeling to get over. I understand feeling imposter syndrome at work as you are paid are being paid to have "knowledge" - but getting it when writing a post on your own website is ridiculous, right? Even as I'm writing this, I'm questioning about whether I should even post it.

But then the trickles of praise come in - a tweet here, someone [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mikestreety) there and I get a "tingle of completion.

So please excuse me if my posts feel guarded, if they seem simplistic or they're not "pushing the boundaries". Despite blogging for 11 years I still have trust issues with my words.
