﻿Fascinating post from @aardrian@toot.cafe about the use of automated tools Vs human accessibility testers. This paragraph near the end pretty much sums it up:

> ﻿This does not mean you should avoid automated tools. Like any tool, it means they have a place in your toolbox. When used correctly they can be extremely helpful. When used in the hands of a novice they can result in a sense of complacency. When not used at all they can be a missed opportunity.
