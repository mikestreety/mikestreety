<p>So yes, I'm getting on the Weeknote train. They won't always be weekly, but a series of small notes, achievements and somewhere for me to dump my mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Git Hooks</strong></h3>
<p>Battled with <a href="https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/using-a-post-merge-git-hook-to-clean-up-old-branches/">git hooks</a> after finding out that there is no such thing as a "pre-merge" hook unfortunately - I wanted to prevent our staging branch being merged into any other branch. I <em>was</em> able to use the "pre-commit" hook to prevent commits to the staging branch.</p>
<h3><strong>Podcasts</strong></h3>
<p>Listened to the "Make Life Work" with <a href="https://sijobling.com/podcast/dan-blundell/">Dan Blundell</a> podcast while cycling up a steep hill this weekend, part of which inspired me to start these very notes.</p>
<h3><strong>Zoom</strong></h3>
<p>With everyone working from home because of the current COVID-19 inspired lockdown, Zoom (the video conferencing company) have had a lot of bad press for their privacy policies and practices. I <a href="https://twitter.com/mikestreety/status/1245460217443356675">compiled a tweet thread</a> of articles revealing the truth about zoom.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>My current hosting is with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>, but the server I have has been bastardised due to my incompetence and indecision. I have decided this week to burn it to the ground and start again. Looking at pricing, i've decided to move to <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. At the time of writing, I have set up the server but not installed or moved anything yet!</p>
