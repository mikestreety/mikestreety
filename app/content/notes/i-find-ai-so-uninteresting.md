Anyone else see "AI" and just switch off?

If I'm looking for some new software or a SaaS, or I open an article and it mentions AI, I immediately go back or close the tab. I'm just so fed up of it appearing in everything.

I get it has a use (I wouldn't even say it's a purpose) but it seems some products have gone hard on it and I'm just bored of hearing about it now.
