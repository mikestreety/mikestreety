The one when Si, Mike & Sam invite Shari Muhima to the conversation about mindsets for creativity and any themes in their side projects.

Season 5 Episode 4 brings our first On The Side guest to the panel discussion, Shari Muhima.

Due to technical failures (Si forgot to record individual "local" tracks in Zoom, instead selecting the single "cloud" option by mistake), the audio quality of this episode isn't optimal and there are occasions when people talk over each other. Apologies in advance.
