The one when Si, Sam and Mike invite Juan Fernandes to join the conversation about what motivates side projects and how to plan them out.

Season 5 Episode 5 brings another regular On The Side member to the panel discussion, Juan Fernandes - frontend developer from Suffolk UK.

This show was recorded with the new Zencaster Beta - a great web app for making podcasts with unlimited localised recordings plus new video facilities, all for free during the pandemic.
