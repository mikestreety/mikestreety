I am the CTO and Lead Developer for Brighton-based web agency [Liquid Light](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/). Working for a small agency I'm required to fill in the gaps in which bigger companies would have specialists. I've come to love every aspect of web development including frontend and backend, DevOps, InfoSec and CI/CD Pipelines.

When I'm not working, I enjoy cycling and spending time with my two kids. I can also be found [reviewing beers](https://alehouse.rocks/) and playing board games.
